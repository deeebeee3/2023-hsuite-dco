# DECENTRALIZED REGISTRY OFFICE NOTES

git checkout develop && git pull origin develop

git fetch --prune 

git branch -D create-nest-js-app

----------


In order to run the frontend, you can easily go to:

cd apps/frontend && run ionic serve 

in order to run the backend, you can easily go to 

cd apps/backend && run npm run start:dev

after you do the checkout, and every time you do a git pull, or generally speaking whenever you need to update the packages, 
you must do it from root dir, so you go to root dir and execute 

npm install - for the all at once

if you want to test the work of your team mate, 

you can use localhost: 

- http://localhost:3000/ for backend 
- http://localhost:8100/ for frontend

keep in mind, use ngrok only when you're working together, so it facilitates the 
on-the-fly changes from backend, and the frontend development/testing in real time

----------

please upgrade to node LTS v18.12.0 at very first.
